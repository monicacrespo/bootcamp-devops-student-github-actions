## 1. Workflow using Cypress GitHub Action

Below is the workflow named `.github\workflows\3.e2e-hangman-front-cypress-action.yaml`.

```yaml
name: Exercise 3 - Run e2e tests using Cypress Action
 
on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  run_e2e_tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout the repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Login to Docker Hub
        uses: docker/login-action@v3
        with:
          username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USER }}
          password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}
      - name: Run Api service in background        
        run: |
          docker run -d -p 3001:3000 ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USER }}/hangman-api:latest           
      - name: Run Front service in background 
        run: |            
          docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -e API_URL=http://localhost:3001 ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USER }}/hangman-front:latest           
      - name: Run e2e tests
        uses: cypress-io/github-action@v6
        with:
          working-directory: ./hangman-e2e/e2e
```

The above workflow has one job named `run_e2e_tests` and it does have the following main steps:

* Run the front and the api services in the background using their latest images.

* Run e2e tests by using the [cypress-io](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action) action. This takes the project's npm package manager lock file, installs dependencies and caches these dependencies for future use. It then proceeds to run Cypress end-to-end tests with the built-in Electron browser and provides a test summary after completion.

## 2. Run the workflow
Please follow the following steps to run our end-to-end tests:
1. Build and push a Docker image of the hangman-api to Docker Hub registry. To do so, run manually the `Exercise 2 - Docker build and push` selecting `hangman-api` as a working directory. 
2. Build and push a Docker image of the hangman-api to Docker Hub registry. To do so, run manually the `Exercise 2 - Docker build and push` selecting `hangman-front` as a working directory.
3. Run manually the `Exercise 3 - Run e2e tests using Cypress Action`.
